Preserving State in HTTP Applications: User Authentication and Session Management

Introduction

HTTP is stateless, meaning each request is independent. Web applications need to remember users across multiple requests for functionalities like user authentication.

Methods to Preserve State

1. Cookies:

What: Small data stored on the client's browser.
How: Server sends a cookie; client returns it with each request.
Example: Set-Cookie: sessionId=abc123

2. Sessions:

What: Server-side storage of user data.
How: Server creates a session ID stored in a cookie; uses it to fetch user data.
Example: Server stores sessionId=abc123; client sends sessionId=abc123 with requests.

3. Tokens (JWT):

What: JSON Web Tokens represent claims between two parties.
How: Server generates a token after login; client sends it with requests.
Example: Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...


Conclusion

Cookies, sessions, and tokens are methods to maintain state in HTTP applications, enabling user authentication and session management.
